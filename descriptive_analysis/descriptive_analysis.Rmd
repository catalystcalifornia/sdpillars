Before engaging in detailed analysis regarding the projectâ€™s research questions, we ran general frequencies of SDPD stops to get a sense of overall trends. This helps us determine if our expected findings are likely to show up in the data and allows us to identify any trends we did not expect. The analysis includes: 

General counts and percents of SDPD stops by key fields in RIPA data, e.g., stop reason, stop result, calls for service, race, age, searches, officer assignment. 

General counts and percents of stops by Gang Suppression Unit and Special Operations Unit (if available) by key fields in RIPA data, e.g., stop reason, stop result, calls for service, race, age, searches.

# Stop Reason and Rersults

## Stops by stop reason

```{r}

# for the rel_stopreason table, it seems like the reason why some people show up in multiple rows is because
# there are different values for 'reason_for_stop_text' or 'reason_for_stop_detail' or 'reason_stop_explaination' BUT the 'reason_for_stop' value remains the same. Which is ultimately what we want for our analysis. So my goal is to create a flattened version of rel_stopreason that shows each person once for their stop reason. UNLESS a person shows up more than once because there is more than one unique stop reason

# similarliy seeing now that rel_persons also has multiple rows for people who have more than 1 perceived age or gender
